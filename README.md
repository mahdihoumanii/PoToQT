# POwer-corrections-for-TOp-Quark-pair-Transverse-momentum-distributions
Here we provide the power expansion of the One-Loop amplitudes for tt~ production. The regularization sheme is conventional dimensional regularization. The Renormalization schemes are the MSbar scheme for the strong coupling and the OS scheme for the top-quark mass and external wave function renormalization constants. 
The results are given in a mathematica script.


The amplitudes for the process a1(p1)+ a2(p2) -> t(p3) + t~(p4) are given as a contraction with tree-level amplitudes, for a1 and a2 being either 2 gluons or a massless quark pair. 


## Running the script
After cloning the repository, one should unzip the directory "amplitudes" in order to call them in the mathematica notebook "QuarkChannel.nb"
