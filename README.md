# Power-Corrections-For-Top-Quark-Pair-Transverse-Momentum-Distributions
I provide fully analytical results for the Squared tree level Matrix elements for the processes involving top quark pairs at LO and NLO and NNLO tree-level QCD.

I also provide with the One-Loop QCD bare amplitude for top anti-top gluon production in the quark-antiquark reaction, contracted with the tree-level amplitude.
